## Hi there! I'm Lam Van Quoc (Constance Anderson)

I'm a 22-ish Game Developer with Unity Engine from a small country in South-east Asia, Vietnam ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³

I have been studying __Unity Engine__ for almost 2 years now, and have developed various of games for _PC_ and _Mobile_ under my own studio - __CST Games__ or collaborated with other friends of mine, although most of them have not really been finished yet because I'm currently a last year student at my university, so a significant percentage of my time must be spent on university/graduation works.

But beside all that, I really like participating in Game Jams, because it's a good place to show off what I've learnt over the years, and also to learn more from other developers as well. Most recently, I have participated in __Ludum Dare 54__ with my entry [__Laboratory Of Doom__](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/54/laboratory-of-doom) and got pretty good scores overall.

As of now, I'm looking for a suitable __internship__ position for __Unity Development / Game Development__. So if you have an offer for me at you company, team or organization, feel free to contact me at ___lvq13302@gmail.com___
